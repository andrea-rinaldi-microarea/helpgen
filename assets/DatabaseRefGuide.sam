[H1] MagoCloud Database Structure
The intended audience of these pages are those power users and developers that need to develop reports on application data, create integrated Microsoft Office solutions using Magic Documents capabilities, or directly integrate third-party applications by accessing business components via MagicLink, through the Web Services interface exposed by the product.

These tasks require a deep knowledge of the internal application behavior and data significance. These pages contain detailed references to database tables and fields and Web Method parameters and return values. The tables are linked to the Business Objects (a.k.a. Documents) that the data belongs to.

For general concepts, there are pages describing the overall design and organization of the application's database structure, as well as the naming convention used for the table and field names, see Database Structure General Concepts.

Finally, a Glossary completes the picture. A significant effort has been devoted to ensuring naming coherence and consistency, which helps with self-understanding of the application structure. See Mago.Net Database Glossary for details.
